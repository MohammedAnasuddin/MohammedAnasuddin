# Initialization — Who I Am

I’m **Mohammed Anasuddin**, a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building systems that are practical, efficient, and thoughtfully designed.
This JS-style structure represents how I see myself as an engineer.

```js
import Engineer from "./profile.js";
let mohammed_anasuddin = new Engineer({
  branch: "CSE",
  cgpa: 8.38,
  college: "St. Peter's Engineering College (Hyderabad)",
  responsiblities: [
    "Former President@CSE-Club",
    "Former Advisor@Origin (CSE-IT Club)"
  ]
});
```

This initializes my identity, background, and leadership roles.

# Core Engineering Mindset — How I Think

My engineering philosophy is simple:
**understand → design → build → refine**

```js
mohammed_anasuddin.setCore({
  role: "SDE-Full Stack Developer",
  stack: "JavaScript Ecosystem",
  focus: "Real-world systems",
  philosophy: "understand → design → build → refine",
});
```

This describes the mental model I follow to build systems that work.

# Curiosity Engine — How I Learn

I learn by exploring internals, reading documentation directly, and experimenting until I fully understand something.

```js
mohammed_anasuddin.enableLearning({
  approach: "understand internals, read docs, experiment",
  belief: "Understanding builds confidence",
});
```

This block outlines my learning behaviour, fueled by curiosity and iteration.
