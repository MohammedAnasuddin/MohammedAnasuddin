// ——————————————————— Overview ———————————————————

### System-First Builder
> **Principle:** Design systems before writing code

> **Style:** Architecture → Flow → Execution

I design systems before I write code — mapping flows, data paths, and behaviors so execution is clean and predictable.

```

idea → problem framing → system design → architecture → build → refine

````

```js
const cycle = ["thought", "design", "build", "ship", "improve"];
````

// —————————————— Curiosity Engine ——————————————

### Curiosity that Builds

> Curiosity = Architecture fuel

I learn by tracing logic, reading docs, and understanding internals — not by copying patterns.

```
question → research → experiment → understand → apply
```

Knowledge builds confidence.
Understanding builds systems.

```js
const learning = { mode: "hands-on", source: "real systems" };
```

// ————————————— Solutions in Progress —————————————

### Solutions in Progress

> Building useful systems — step by step

> Engineering meaningful tools, not demos

#### LookJobs — Automated Job Discovery

```js
const LookJobs = {
  goal: "Automate job discovery & reduce daily search fatigue",
  coreIdea: "Scheduled scraping + unified job feed",
  architecture: ["Puppeteer", "PostgreSQL + JSONB", "Cron jobs", "React"],
  status: "Expanding filters and data sources",
};
```

#### Twisty XO — Strategy Reinvented

```js
const TwistyXO = {
  goal: "Make tic-tac-toe strategic and replayable",
  idea: "Expiring moves → constant adaptation",
  tech: ["React", "Context API"],
  status: "Playable — refining AI & UX",
};
```

#### CampusBuzz — Realtime Campus Events

```js
const CampusBuzz = {
  goal: "Centralize campus event discovery & participation",
  system: "Realtime events + auth + dashboards",
  tech: ["Flutter", "Firebase"],
  status: "Prototype — improving UX & analytics",
};
```

// ——————————— Engineering Toolkit ————————————

### Engineering Toolkit

> Tools chosen for clarity and predictability

```
UI & Interaction     → React, TypeScript, Tailwind
Application Logic    → Node.js, Express, Auth, APIs
Data Layer           → PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase
Automation Systems   → Puppeteer, Cron Jobs, DOM analysis
Craft Discipline     → Clean code, debugging, docs, testing mindset
```

```js
const engineer = ["systems", "logic", "automation", "UI clarity"];
```

// ——————————————— Roadmap ————————————————

### Engineering Roadmap

> Evolution of capability, not features

> AI = enhancement, not hype

```
→ deeper system architecture
→ automation & intelligent flows
→ scalable real-world applications
→ integrating AI where it truly adds value
```

```js
const direction = ["system depth", "AI utility", "scalable engineering"];
```
